                        <p>She Believed She Could So She Did… </p>
                        <p>Three carefree friends who loved spending time flipping through high fashion ads and
                            wondering through shops admiring the craftsmanship of beautiful bags drinking coffees and
                            laughing while enjoying the moment of connectiveness and luxury goods. A love for fashion,
                            artistry, and luxury goods was born. Each friend had her own deep personal connection and
                            story of what each bag means to them. Each bag contains a story, of love, tears, joy, and
                            coming of age. In over 30 years of friendship each bag holds our laughs, stories and
                            secrets.</p>

                        <p>These friends often found themselves making wish lists and texting pictures between them.
                            While the miles and lifestyles separated them, one thing remained consistent, their
                            appreciation and love for these iconic items. As they grew and matured, they often found
                            themselves moving from wish lists to someday lists.</p>

                        <p>In the midst of a global pandemic, with business travel and girls’ trips becoming nonexistent
                            and a financial hardship being felt by many of their friends, selfcare fell by the wayside.
                            Trips home to Hawaii to see loved ones paused, vacations cancelled, traditions with family
                            put on pause. Over a group text message Bags4BFFs was born. Just because you are a mom, a
                            wife, a daughter, a caretaker, or a provider doesn’t mean you need to live a life void of
                            luxury.
                        </p>
                        <p>A company founded on the principle that luxury should be accessible to anyone, that self-care
                            is important and makes us better BFFS, moms, and women, and that giving back to
                            organizations that empower women to better their lives and leave dangerous situations, we
                            give you options for the luxury you deserve.</p>
